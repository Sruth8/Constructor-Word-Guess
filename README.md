# Constructor-Word-Guess
Advanced Java (optional)

This is basically a "hangman game." The rules are the player is given 10 chances to guess the word by each letter in that word.

The theme is Most famous starships. 

How it works

At the start of the game, there will be the correct amount of blank spaces or underscores that corresponds to the word. The user can guess a letter by pressing a key on the keyboard. If the letter is correct, it will take the place of the underscore in it's correct position. If it is a wrong letter, the user will be able to see it listed as "Wrong Guess." The game will restart with a new word once the game is over. 

Enjoy!
